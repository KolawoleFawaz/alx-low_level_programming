# 0x16 - Simple Shell

This is a custom UNIX command-line shell written in C, developed as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The shell supports executing user commands, built-in functions, command chaining, environment management, and more â€” mimicking basic features of `/bin/sh`.

---

## Features

- Interactive shell with custom prompt
- Execute system commands and custom built-ins
- Handle command chaining with `;`
- Environment variable management
- Command history support
- Input parsing and tokenization
- Variable replacement (e.g., `$?`, `$$`)
- Graceful error handling
- Custom reimplementation of standard library functions
- Supports both interactive and non-interactive modes
