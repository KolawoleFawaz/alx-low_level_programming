## üß† About

This repository showcases my journey through the ALX curriculum, covering essential topics such as:

- **C programming fundamentals**
- **Control structures and loops**
- **Functions and recursion**
- **Pointers, arrays, and strings**
- **Memory management with `malloc` and `free`**
- **Static and dynamic libraries**
- **Structures and typedefs**
- **Function pointers and variadic functions**
- **Linked lists and data structures**
- **Bit manipulation**
- **File I/O operations**

Each project is designed to build upon the previous, reinforcing concepts and introducing new challenges.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To compile and run any of the C programs:

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd 0x00-hello_world

2. Compile the C file using gcc:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic filename.c -o output

3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./output

Replace the filename.c with the actual file name and output with your desired executable name.

## Tools & Technologies 
- language: C (c89 standard)
- compiler: gcc with flags -wall -wextra -werror -pedantic
- debugger: gdb
- memory leak checker: Valgrind
- code style checker: Betty
-Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
